This directory contains the source file and a Makefile for generating a random
environment. The new environment will be saved as environment.txt and
environment.js and will be read on startup by your program.

This directory already contains an environment, but if you'd like to, you may
regenerate a new one:

$ make
$ ./make_env

To see the output of your program, open index.html.
